* Widget :
  ----
   - Blueprint or Recipie about What UI should look like 

* Element :
  ----
   - Holds info abt where widget stays in relative to other widgets in Widget Tree
   - It just implements BuildContext 
    
   - Context :- Some Meta-Information
   

* RenderObject :
  -----
   -> Beyond the Widgets Layer there is Rennder Layer 
   -> So Widget Tree uses Render Tree underhood via Element Tree

   - RenderObjects :- deal with layout | Painting | Hit Testing | Accessibility
        \
         -> Everything you see on Screen is RenderObject 
            Everything You code is Widgets

        Eg RenderBox :- 
             - 2d Coordinates Render Objects
             - Most flutter objects are RenderBox 

   -> RenderObjects can sync from frame to frame 
   -> RenderObject can be Re-Used which helps to improve Performances

   - If widget is removed from tree, then corresponding element is detached & so as corresp RenderObject

   [Keys - Significance]
    -> Flutter uses Keys to recognize if any obj move to new location so that it can utilize the same obj 

   -> If you wannt to move widget to completetly diff part of Entire Tree - then you need {Global Key}
