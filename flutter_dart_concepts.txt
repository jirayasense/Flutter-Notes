* Async vs Isolates :
  ---------
   -> Async doesnt make switching of thread, i.e code still run on same thread but concurrently
   -> not seperate thread 
   -> just jump between diff part of program

   If its heavy work then go for parallelism : 2 program in parallel 
     
   Isolates :
   -----
   -> parallelism in Flutter(dart)
   -> on different thread
   -> heavy processing while also smooth UI for user on main thread
   -> Run in parallel


* yield and yield*
  ----------
   -> are often use to make generators or recursive call 

* factories redirection :
  ----------
   use = with factory constructor for redirection
