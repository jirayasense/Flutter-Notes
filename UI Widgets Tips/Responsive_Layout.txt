* Responsive Layout in Flutter :
  --------------
   2 ways 
   1) Mediaquery
   2) LayoutBuilder


* Mediaquery :
  -----
   - Here we manually need to store variable & write logics

   - orientations 
       - potrait or landscape

   - isMobile or Tablet
       - size.shortSide < 600 

* OrientationBuilder :
  ------
   -> Widget that can be used in place of Mediaquery

* LayoutBuilder :
  ----
   - Here under the hood its using Mediaquery (I guess)
   - It provides us with Widget So that we can use it in Widget Tree directly
   - It provide Consntraints as well
