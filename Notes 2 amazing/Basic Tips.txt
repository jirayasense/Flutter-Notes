Flutter maintains three trees in parallel: 
the Widget, Element and RenderObject trees.

Asynchronous code should always check if the mounted property is true before calling setstate(), 
because the widget may no longer be part of the widget tree.

The rule of thumb for dispose() is to check any properties 
you define in your state and make sure youâ€™ve disposed of them properly.

By adding an inherited widget in your tree, you can reference the data from any of its descendants. 
This is known as lifting state up.
