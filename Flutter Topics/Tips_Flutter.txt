* Side Effects In Flutter :
  -----
  Mutating state or calling async code inside the build method can cause unwanted widget rebuilds 
  and unintended behaviour


* Flutter Hooks :
  ---------
   useState() works in Flutter Hooks
     \
      It creates/simulates the ValueNotifier & rebuilds the HookWidget whenever its value changes


* Adaptive vs Responsive :
  -----------
   2 ideas of Adaptive & Responsive
   - How much space do I have on the Screen ??
   - What is the platform Capabilities ??

   Adaptive :- 
     - an app is capable to change functionalities based on the platform's capabilities.
     - Functionality Perspective

     Eg 
        Geolocation Service (Sensor) for Mobile Devices
            \
             Diff OS (Android & IOS) has diff way specific to Platform underneath

   Responsive :-
     - Changing how something looks based on the screen available
     - Visibility Perspective

   Widgets :-
    1) MediaQuery    (Entire Screen)
    2) LayoutBuilder

   -> Theme.of(context).platform   // to get underneath platform details
        \
         -> For thing's visible to app user's (ie Responsiveness)

   -> dart:io.platform  // (Adaptiveness)
        \
         -> For Functionality Differences
